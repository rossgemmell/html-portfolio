<h2> My Top 3 Funny Films </h2>
<hr/> 
<h3> Johnny English</h3>
<p> Funny detective. Doing the wrong thing but coming good in the end.</p>
<h3> Pink Panther</h3>
<p> Also funny detective, doing silly stuff but solving mysteries.</p>
<h3> Hunt For the Wilderpeople</h3>
<p> Hilarious film. Can't remember too much about it. Set in Australia. About a young guy who's been adopted. I would liked to watch again. </p>
